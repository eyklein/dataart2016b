She knows this car would go out of control.<br>\n<br>\r\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\r\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\r\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world.<br>\r\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love.Well we crossed the panthandle and then we headed towards Amarillo<br>\r\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wrecking lot outside of <br>\r\ntown about a mile<br>\r\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us<br>\r\ncome rolling up in a trail of dust<br>\r\nShe said \"Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while\".<br>\n<br>\r\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming<br>\r\na ride back to where she started<br>\r\nBut she changed the subject every time money came up<br>\r\nShe said \"Welcome to the land of the living dead\". You could tell she was <br>\r\nso broken-hearted<br>\r\nShe said \"Even the swap meets around here are pretty corrupt\".<br>\n<br>\r\n\"How far are you all going ?\" Ruby asked us with a sigh<br>\r\n\"We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn<br>\r\nUntil the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies\"<br>\r\nRuby just smiled and said. \"Ah you know some babies never learn\".<br>\n<br>\r\nSomething about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head<br>\r\nBut I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play<br>\r\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved<br>\r\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be looking my way.<br>\n<br>\r\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\r\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\r\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world.<br>\r\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell they were looking for somebody with a pompadour<br>\r\nI was crossing the street when shots rang out<br>\r\nI didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran<br>\r\nWe got him cornered in the churchyard ? I heard somebody shout.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said:<br>\r\n\"A man with no alibi\"<br>\r\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you<br>\r\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears<br>\r\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do.<br>\n<br>\r\nNow I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trepass but sometimes <br>\r\nyou just find yourself over the line<br>\r\nOh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now<br>\r\nYou now I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better<br>\r\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how.<br>\r\nWell I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck<br>\r\nYeh but you know it's not the one I had in mind<br>\r\nHe's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about<br>\r\nBut I'll se him in anything so I'll stand in line.<br>\n<br>\r\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\r\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\r\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world<br>\r\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love.<br>\n<br>\r\nYou know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned<br>\r\nThe only things we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name <br>\r\nwasn't Henry Porter<br>\r\nAnd you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too <br>\r\ngood for this world<br>\r\nJust like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind <br>\r\nin the French Quarter.<br>\n<br>\r\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who <br>\r\nare most content<br>\r\nI don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone<br>\r\nYou always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most <br>\r\nconvenient then they repent<br>\r\nAnd I always said. \"Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on\".<br>\n<br>\r\nThere was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice<br>\r\nI don't remember who I was or where I was bound<br>\r\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot <br>\r\nin the back<br>\r\nSeems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down.<br>\n<br>\r\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\r\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\r\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world<br>\r\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love.\n",

in the highlands, I'm gonna go there when<br>\r\nI feel good enough to go.<br>\n<br>\r\nWindows were shakin' all night in my dreams<br>\r\nEverything was exactly the way that it seems<br>\r\nWoke up this mornin' and I looked at the same old page<br>\r\nSame old rat race, life in the same old cage.<br>\n<br>\r\nI don't want nothin' from anyone, ain't that much to take<br>\r\nWouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake<br>\r\nFeel like a prisoner in a world of mystery<br>\r\nI wish someone would come and push back the clock for me.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell, my heart's in the highlands, wherever I roam<br>\r\nThat's where I'll be when I get called home<br>\r\nThe wind it whispers to the buck-eyed trees of rhyme<br>\r\nWell, my heart's in the highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.<br>\n<br>\r\nI'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound<br>\r\nSomeone's always yellin', \"Turn him down\"<br>\r\nFeel like I'm driftin', driftin' from scene to scene<br>\r\nI'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.<br>\n<br>\r\nInsanity is smashin' up against my soul<br>\r\nYou could say I was on anything but a roll<br>\r\nIf I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top<br>\r\nWhat would I do with it anyway, maybe take it to the pawn shop.<br>\n<br>\r\nMy heart's in the highlands at the break of dawn<br>\r\nBy the beautiful lake of the black swan<br>\r\nBig white clouds like chariots that swing down low<br>\r\nWell, my heart's in the highlands, only place left to go.<br>\n<br>\r\nI'm in Boston town, in some restaurant<br>\r\nI got no idea what I want<br>\r\nOr maybe I do but, I'm just really not sure<br>\r\nWaitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around<br>\r\nShe studies me closely as I sit down<br>\r\nShe got a pretty face, with long white shiny legs<br>\r\nI said, \"Tell me what I want,\" she say, \"You probably want hard boiled eggs.\"<br>\n<br>\r\nI say, \"That's right, bring me some.\"<br>\r\nShe says, \"We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come.\"<br>\r\nThen she says, \"I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me.\"<br>\r\nI said, \"I would if I could but I don't do sketches from memory.\"<br>\n<br>\r\nWell, she then, she says, \"I'm right here in front of you, or<br>\r\nhaven't you looked?\"<br>\r\nI say, \"All right, I know but I don't have my drawing book.\"<br>\r\nShe gives me a napkin, she say, \"You can do it on that.\"<br>\r\nI say, \"Yes I could but I don't know where my pencil is at.\"<br>\n<br>\r\nShe pulls one out from behind her ear<br>\r\nShe says, \"All right now go ahead, draw me, I'm stayin' right here.\"<br>\r\nI make a few lines and I show it for her to see<br>\r\nWell, she takes her napkin and throws it back and says, \"That<br>\r\ndon't look a thing like me.\"<br>\n<br>\r\nI said, \"Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does.\"<br>\r\nShe say, \"You must be jokin',\" I say, \"I wish I was.\"<br>\r\nThen she says, \"You don't read women authors do ya?\" at least<br>\r\nthat's what I think I hear her say<br>\r\nWell, I said, \"How would you know and what would it matter anyway?\"<br>\n<br>\r\nWell she says, \"You just don't seem like you do.\" I said,<br>\r\n\"You're way wrong.\"<br>\r\nShe says \"Which ones have you read then?\" I say, \"I've read<br>\r\nErica Jong.\"<br>\r\nShe goes away for a minute and I slide out, out of my chair<br>\r\nI step outside back to the busy street but nobody is goin' anywhere.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell, my heart's in the highlands with the horses and hounds<br>\r\nWay up in the border country far from the towns<br>\r\nWith the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow<br>\r\nMy heart's in the highlands, I can't see any other way to go.<br>\n<br>\r\nEvery day is the same thing, out the door<br>\r\nFeel further away than ever before<br>\r\nSome things in life it just gets too late to learn<br>\r\nWell, I'm lost somewhere, I must have made a few bad turns.<br>\n<br>\r\nI see people in the park forgettin' their troubles and woes<br>\r\nThey're drinkin' and dancin', wearin' bright colored clothes<br>\r\nAll the young men, with the young women lookin' so good<br>\r\nWell, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute, if I could.<br>\n<br>\r\nI'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog<br>\r\nTalkin' to myself in a monologue<br>\r\nI think what I need might be a full length leather coat<br>\r\nSomebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.<br>\n<br>\r\nThe sun is beginnin' to shine on me<br>\r\nBut it's not like the sun that used to be<br>\r\nThe party's over and there's less and less to say<br>\r\nI got new eyes, everything looks far away.<br>\n<br>\r\nWell, my heart's in the highlands at the break of day<br>\r\nOver the hills and far away<br>\r\nThere's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow<br>\r\nWell, I'm already there in my mind, and that's good enough for now.\n",

shut down<br>\nAnyone with any sense had already left town<br>\nHe was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nHe moved across the mirrored room \"Set it up for everyone\" he said<br>\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads<br>\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin<br>\n\"Could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins ?\"<br>\nThen he moved into the corner face down like the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nBackstage the girls were playing five card stud by the stairs<br>\nLily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair<br>\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide<br>\nA gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside<br>\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nBig Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine<br>\nHe made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine<br>\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place<br>\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste<br>\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town<br>\nShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown<br>\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear<br>\n\"Sorry darling, that I'm late\", but he didn't seem to hear<br>\nHe was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\n\"I know I've seen that face somewhere\" Big Jim was thinking to himself<br>\n\"Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf\"<br>\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim<br>\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him<br>\nStaring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nLily was a princess she was fair-skinned and precious as a child<br>\nShe did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled<br>\nShe'd come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs<br>\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere<br>\nBut she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.<br>\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined<br>\nThe drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind<br>\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring<br>\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king<br>\nNo nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife<br>\nShe was tired of the attention tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife<br>\nShe had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide<br>\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died<br>\nShe was gazing to the future riding on the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nLily took her dress off and buried it away<br>\n\"Has your luck run out?\" she laughed at him.<br>\n\"Well I guess you must have known it would someday<br>\nBe careful not to touch the wall there's a brand new coat of paint<br>\nI'm glad to see you're still alive you're looking like a saint\"<br>\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair<br>\n\"There's something funny going on\" he said \" I can just feel it in the air\"<br>\nHe went to get the hanging judge but the hanging judge was drunk<br>\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk<br>\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nNo one knew the circumstance, but they say it happened pretty quick<br>\nThe door to the dressing room burst open a Colt revolver clicked<br>\nAnd big Jim was standing there you couldn't say surprised<br>\nRosemary right beside him studying her eyes<br>\nShe was with big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br>\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe it's said that they got off with quite a haul<br>\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br>\nFor one more member who had business back in town<br>\nBut they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.<br>\n<br>\nThe next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black<br>\nBig Jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back<br>\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows she didn't even blink<br>\nThe hanging judge was sober he hadn't had a drink<br>\nThe only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts.<br>\nThe cabaret was empty now a sign said. \"Closed for repair\"<br>\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair<br>\nShe was thinking about her father who she very rarely saw<br>\nThinking about Rosemary and thinking about the law<br>\nBut most of all she was thinking about the Jack of Hearts.\n",

then exploded<br>\nPropellers they failed to start<br>\nThe boilers overloaded<br>\nThe ship's bow split apart<br>\n<br>\nPassengers were flying<br>\nBackward, forward, far and fast<br>\nThey mumbled,

began to slide<br>\nHis valiant heart was beating<br>\nHe pushed the tables aside<br>\n<br>\nGlass of shattered crystal<br>\nLay scattered roundabout<br>\nHe strapped on both his pistols<br>\nHow long could he hold out?<br>\n<br>\nHis men and his companions<br>\nWere nowhere to be seen<br>\nIn silence there he waited for<br>\nTime and space to intervene<br>\n<br>\nThe passageway was narrow<br>\nThere was blackness in the air<br>\nHe saw every kind of sorrow<br>\nHeard voices everywhere<br>\n<br>\nAlarm-bells were ringing<br>\nTo hold back the swelling tide<br>\nFriends and lovers

dance<br>\n<br>\nThey lowered down the lifeboats<br>\nFrom the sinking wreck<br>\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats<br>\nBroken backs and broken necks<br>\n<br>\nThe bishop left his cabin<br>\nTo help others in need<br>\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens<br>\nSaid, \"The poor are yours to feed\"<br>\n<br>\nDavey the brothel-keeper<br>\nCame out dismissed his girls<br>\nSaw the
